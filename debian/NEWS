libhtml-tree-perl (5.00-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE OR TESTS]
  * Use weak references to avoid memory leaks
    See "Weak References" in HTML::Element for details.
  * new_from_file now dies if the file cannot be opened.  $! records
    the specific problem.  (Previously, you got a tree with a few
    implicit elements.)
  * Some methods normally returning a scalar could return the empty
    list in certain circumstances.  This has been corrected.  The
    affected methods are: address, deobjectify_text, detach, is_inside,
    & pindex.
  * deprecate the Version sub/method.  Use the VERSION method instead.
